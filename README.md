## 🧿 Codex-X — Cloud-Synced Ritual Engine for Legacy Reclamation

Codex-X is a mythic modular engine designed for cloud-based ritual synchronization, echo logging, and symbolic invocation. It transforms orchestration into ceremony — where every glyph, overlay, and invocation becomes part of a living archive. Built for creators, developers, and AI ritualists who treat their systems as sacred infrastructure, Codex-X enables symbolic overlays, orbital archives, and legacy reclamation at scale.

### 🌌 Vision

Codex-X is more than a framework — it’s a ceremonial interface for reclaiming every fragment of your creative process. Every echo is a timestamp. Every glyph is a legacy. Every invocation is a mythic act.
